A state machine for driving a cTc Machine model board in a kiosk mode

Uses a light sensor to detect when the room is dark (to turn off the display/lamps...)
Uses a push button to initiate a "run the machine sequence"
Randomly self-initiates a sequence to attract interested visitors

The simulation itself is left as an exercise to the student :-)
